# fancy-react-core

A core implementation library for IDE tools to help with react refactoring tasks.

Right now the primary consumer of this library is [Fancy React](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fancy-react.fancy-react-code), which offers these actions as an extension for `Visual Studio Code`. An older version is available for [atom](https://atom.io/packages/fancy-react), which was the starting point for this project.
